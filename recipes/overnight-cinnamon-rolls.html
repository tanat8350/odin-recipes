  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Ingredients</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup milk</li>
    <li>⅓ cup butter</li>
    <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
    <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
    <li>4 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>3 eggs</li>
    <li>¾ cup brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>½ cup raisins</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon light corn syrup</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 ¼ cups sifted confectioners' sugar</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons half-and-half cream</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Steps</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat the milk in a small saucepan until it bubbles, then remove from heat. Add the butter and stir until melted;
      let cool until lukewarm.</li>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, dissolve the yeast in the milk mixture. Add the sugar, 3 cups of flour, salt and eggs;
      stir well to combine. Add the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring well after each addition. When the
      dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and supple, about 8
      minutes.</li>
    <li>Lightly oil a large mixing bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth
      and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Deflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and roll into a 10x 14 inch rectangle. Lightly
      brush the far edge with water. In a small bowl combine the cinnamon and 3/4 cup brown sugar and sprinkle over the
      rectangles. Then sprinkle the raisins and chopped nuts over the dough. Roll up the dough into a log and seal the
      seam.</li>
    <li>Cut the dough into 12 equal pieces; place the pieces in a greased 9x13 inch baking pan, or 12 inch deep dish
      pizza pan. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator to rise overnight.</li>
    <li>The next morning, preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Take the rolls out of the refrigerator and let
      stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Bake the rolls for 25 to 30 minutes or until golden. Meanwhile, combine the corn syrup with the vanilla in a
      small bowl. Whisk in the powdered sugar and enough cream to make a thick glaze; set aside. Drizzle the glaze over
      the rolls and serve warm.</li>
